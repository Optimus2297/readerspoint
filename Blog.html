		<h2>Name:</h2>
		<p>Killing Hemingway</p></br>
		<h2>Author:</h2>
		<p>Brian D. Meeks</p>
		<h2>Book Overview:</h2>
		<p>As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and a still considerable, though not so extensive, investment of time to read. This sense of book has a restricted and an unrestricted sense. In the restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage that reflects the fact that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls, and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. So, for instance, each part of Aristotle's Physics is called a book, as of course the Bible encompasses many different books. In the unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts.
		Historians have some documents showing that the working title of the piece was "The Matadors".How much Hemingway received for the literary piece is unknown, but some sources state it was $200.I also liked that I read this book because it gave me a chance to talk to mom about making mistakes and how I don't like making them.I also liked that I read this book because it gave me a chance to talk to mom about making mistakes and how I don't like making them.</p></br>
		<h2>Genre:</h2>
		<p>Thriller, Drama</p></br>
		<h2>Review:</h2>
		<p>This book was about a bird who didn't yet know how to fly.The bird has to decide if it will try to fly, but it was not sure if it wants to. The bird thought, "If I never forever endeavor" then I won't ever learn. On one wing, he worries he might fail and on the other wing he thinks of how he may succeed. He worries that if he tries, he may get lost in the world. That makes him want to stay in his nest where he's safe.I think this book would help other children to learn that trying new things can be scary, but sometimes when we try, we can find things that make us happy too. And this book will help others know that mistakes are okay and part of learning.My favorite part is that the bird tried and learned that she could fly. I also liked that I read this book because it gave me a chance to talk to mom about making mistakes and how I don't like making them. Then I learned they are good and part of learning.Boys and girls who are 3 to 8 years old would like this book because it teaches about trying a new thing and how it's important to get past being scared so you can learn new things.I give the book 5 stars since I think it's important for other children to learn about courage.</p>
